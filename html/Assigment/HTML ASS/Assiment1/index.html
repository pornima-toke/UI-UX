    <p><abbr>One day</abbr>,the goddess <pre> Parvati made a small boy out of clay and breathed life into him.</pre> She asked him to guard 
     the door to her bath and not let anyone enter.<hr> Soon after, Lord Shiva, Parvati's husband, arrived and tried
     to enter the house. The boy, who didn't know who Shiva was,<mark>Lord Shiva fought with the boy and cut off his head.</mark> bravely stood his 
     <del>ground and refused to let him pass</del>.Angered by the refusal,  
     <q>Parvati was furious and heartbroken when she saw what had happened.</q> To soothe her, <em>Shiva promised to bring
     the boy back to life.</em> He sent his men to  find the head of the first creature they saw. 
     <b><strong>The men brought back the head of an elephant,</strong></b> which Shiva placed on the boy's body, and <strong>Ganesha was born</strong></p>
     <p>Moral: <ins>Intelligence and wit can help solve problems.</ins> Showing respect to parents is also important.The moon's curse
     After eating a huge feast, Ganesha was riding home on his mouse. The little mouse stumbled and Ganesha fell to the
    ground, <i>causing his round belly </i><em>to burst open and his sweets to spill out</em>. The moon saw this and laughed at him.
Ganesha was angry and embarrassed. He threw one of his tusks at the moon and cursed it, saying no one should look at it. The moon immediately felt sorry and begged for forgiveness. Ganesha, who is kind and forgiving, couldn't take back the curse, but he did change it. He said the moon would slowly get bigger and then smaller over 15 days, disappearing for one night each month.
<b>Moral</b>:<blockquote> Never laugh at someone else's misfortune. Even when angry, it is important to forgive.</blockquote><br>
The writer of the Mahabharat <address>The great sage Vyasa wanted to write the epic story of the Mahabharata</address> but needed a fast and reliable writer. He asked Ganesha for help. Ganesha agreed, but only on the condition that Vyasa would narrate the story without stopping. Vyasa accepted but added his own condition: Ganesha must understand each verse before writing it.
As Vyasa narrated the long story, <mark>Ganesha wrote nonstop.</mark> When Ganesha's quill broke, <hr>he quickly snapped off his own tusk and used it as a pen to keep writing. In this way, they worked together to create one of the most magnificent stories ever told.
<b>Moral</b>: When committed to a task, <small>give it your best, even if it requires a sacrifice.</small></p>
